= nixos_custom_scripts

Small repo to easily import custom /bin/sh scripts into nixos installation.

Will import all scripts from *bin* folder and make them available on the PATH in nixos.

== Usage in configuration.nix - inside home manager module

.Add this in packages and adapt the sha256 value
[source,haskell]
----
    home.packages = [
      #Try to support adding custom /bin/sh executable scripts from public github repo
      # https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/k3acxu/is_there_a_declarative_way_to_have_shell_scripts/
      #(pkgs.fetchgit { url = "https://example.com/your-repo.git"; sha256 = lib.fakeSha256 /* nix will throw an error with the correct hash to use, replace this with that hash */; })
      (pkgs.fetchgit { url = "https://github.com/Valpha80/nixos_custom_scripts.git"; sha256 = "insertProperCommitHashHere-use-previous-line-to-get-latest"; })
    ];

== Specific for mpv-protocol script

.Also need to add mapping of x-scheme-handler/mpv to use this *mpv-protocol* script that will now be included in the path
[source,haskell]
----
    xdg.desktopEntries.mpv-protocol = {
      name = "MPV protocol nixos";
      comment = "Open mpv:// links with MPV";
      type = "Application";
      mimeType = [
        "x-scheme-handler/mpv"
      ];
      exec = "mpv-protocol %u";
      noDisplay = true;
      icon = "mpv";
      terminal = false;
    };
----

Known limitation; this works with Brave browser but fails due to some env configuration issue when run through xdg from Vivaldi browser.
